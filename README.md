# Breadth-First-Search-Algorithem
The purpose of this project was just for me to learn about Breadth First Search! I really understood and picked up new things throughout this process. You may self create a graph with connecting nodes and input this into the code. By choosing 2 nodes on your graph and calling the function, it will then return the shortest path using BFS!
